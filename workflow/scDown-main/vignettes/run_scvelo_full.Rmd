# Define Variables specific for `scDown::run_scvelo_full`
Set up the environment for running full scVelo by defining key variables. Restart R and load `library(scDown)` before `run_scvelo_full`. 

Loading a h5ad object containing spliced and unspliced RNA data is required. The h5ad file can be automatically generated by `run_scvelo()`. The cell type annotation column `annotation_column` is defined to specify the cell type or other annotation labels, ensuring the analysis runs with the correct group. The working directory `output_dir` by default is the current directory and can be changed to specific path. The `mode` to conduct scvelo velocity calculation can be either 'stochastic (default)', 'deterministic', or 'dynamical (slowest)'


```{r, message = FALSE}
# input h5ad file path and name. Default "scvelo/rds/obj_spliced_unspliced.h5ad", which is output from run_scvelo()
h5ad_file="inst/extdata/DentateGyrus/10X43_1.h5ad"

# Mode to conduct scvelo velocity calculation, default 'stochastic'
mode = 'stochastic'

# The number of top differential velocity genes to plot phase portrait for, default 5
top_gene = 5
```

# Run `scDown::run_scvelo_full`: Read h5ad and run scVelo using original scVelo
This part performs RNA velocity calculations from h5ad file using the original scVelo python package.

## Run full scVelo for entire data

2.1.2 [Cluster-specific Differential Velocity Genes](#cluster-specific-differential-velocity-genes)

2.1.3 [Trajectory Inference using PAGA](#trajectory-inference-using-paga)

```{r}
start_time <- proc.time()

# Run full scVelo using original scvelo
run_scvelo_full(h5ad_file = h5ad_file,
                output_dir = output_dir,
                annotation_column = annotation_column)

end_time <- proc.time()
elapsed_time <- end_time - start_time

# Print the elapsed time
print(elapsed_time)

```
```{r}
# elapsed_time: 2 min
```

### Calculate RNA Velocity using scVelo 
This step takes in an AnnData object in h5ad and performs all basic velocity calculations enabled by scVelo. It also outputs basic figures such as spliced/unspliced count proportion and RNA velocity vectors on umap.

This plot visualizes the % spliced Vs. unspliced RNA for each cell type.

```

```

This plot visualizes the vector arrow on UMAP embeddings. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/ALL_embedding_arrow.png")

```

### Cluster-specific Differential Velocity Genes
This step performs a differential velocity t-test to find genes that explain the directionality of calculated velocity vectors. It tests which genes have cell type-specific differential velocity expression, i.e., being siginificantly higher/lower compared to the remaining population, and visualizes the phase portrait (ratio of spliced/unspliced RNA abundance) for highly ranked genes, i.e., the unspliced mRNAs (y-axis) Vs. spliced mRNAs (x-axis). Transcriptional induction for a particular gene results in an increase of (newly transcribed) precursor unspliced mRNAs. 

This plot visualizes the phase portrait for top 5 highly ranked differential velocity genes for each cell type.

### Trajectory Inference using PAGA
This step performs trajectory inference using the [PAGA method](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1663-x). It provides a graph-like map of the data with solid edges corresponding to the transition confidence between two cell type groups (defined in annotation_column). Here, PAGA is extended by velocity-inferred directionality and predicts transitions/lineages between groups.

This plot visualizes the directed graphs of predicted lineages. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/ALL_paga_graph.png")

```

## Run full scVelo for user-defined groups
If specific groups of conditions or time points are provided, we subset the h5ad object for each group of conditions or time points, and then compute velocity using original scVelo and visualize all the above figures in each individual group. 

```{r}
# subset a group of conditions or time points used to calculate RNA velocity
groups=list("12","35")
# specify which metadata column of the Seurat object should be used for the group subset 
group_column="age(days)"

# Run full scVelo using original scvelo for specific groups
run_scvelo_full(h5ad_file = h5ad_file,
                output_dir = output_dir,
                annotation_column = annotation_column,
                groups=groups,
                group_column=group_column)

```

This plot visualizes the velocity stream on UMAP embeddings. 
```{r}
# time point: day 12 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/12_embedding_stream.png")

```
```{r}
# time point: day 35 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/35_embedding_stream.png")

```

This plot visualizes the directed PAGA graphs of predicted lineages. 
```{r}
# time point: day 12 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/12_paga_graph.png")

```
```{r}
# time point: day 35 
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("../scdown/scvelo_full/35_paga_graph.png")

```


# Summary

This document outlines a pipeline for analyzing RNA velocity directly employing the original Python package scVelo. The pipeline begins with the h5ad file with spliced and unspliced RNA matrices that could be automatically generated by run_scvelo(). It runs scVelo by fitting a stochastic model to each geneâ€™s splicing dynamics and visualizes RNA velocity in stream plots, grid plots and arraw plots. It also identifies differential velocity genes via statistical testing and visualizes top-ranked genes in phase portraits, highlighting those influencing state transitions. 

Apart from that, it conducts Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA), which calculates transition probabilities and generates directed lineage graphs, providing a high-level overview of cell-state relationships, supporting lineage and trajectory inference. 

Additionally, the pipeline supports focused analysis by selecting specific time points  (e.g., age groups 12 and 35) or comparing user-defined groups. For each group of conditions or time points, the h5ad object is subsetted and velocity is computed. 

This python-based workflow offers a robust framework for analyzing transcriptional dynamics, providing insights into cellular trajectories and transitions.

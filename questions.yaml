task: >
  You have been provided with a processed single-cell dataset (Seurat or h5ad format) and the scDown downstream analysis pipeline. Your task is to execute the workflow in `/workflow` on data located in `/data` and answer the following questions using the outputs.

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: proportion_analysis
    text: "Which cell type had the largest absolute increase in proportion between conditions?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: communication_analysis
    text: "Which signaling pathway exhibited the highest total information flow in the CellChat output?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: pseudotime
    text: "What is the pseudotime value of the earliest cell along the Monocle3 trajectory?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 1.0

  - id: q4
    stage: rna_velocity
    text: "Which cell cluster showed the highest average RNA velocity magnitude?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: comprehensive_summary
    text: "How many genes were identified as drivers of the trajectory (monocle3)?"
    answer_type: integer_exact
